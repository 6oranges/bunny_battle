# bunny_battle
A project I created for fun. It is a remake of a python project which itself was a remake of another python project which was built for southern utah code camp 2015 by my family.
This project is a PWA (Progressive Web App). It is a website but can be played like a native app with support for gamepads, mobile friendly and offline capabliity.
It is currently a bit unbalanced and the only way to add more players is with more remotes. I use NES nintendo game controllers with usb ports.
It works with up to 8 players tested, on mobile and desktop, but only in firefox unfortunately. Google Chrome actually sucks at something. Join the discussion to fix this tragedy.

Google Chrome, I'm not sad I am just.. disappointed... very disappointed. How can you play this game at a party when you can only use 4 remotes? Don't be like safari, support your users.
